## Background

I developed this application to make it easy for cyclists to estimate their critical power (CP) and runners to estimate their critical speed (CS).

The sustainable duration of exercise is dependent upon the intensity (i.e., power or speed) at which the exercise is performed. This fundamental concept is known as the intensity-duration relationship, and for exercise durations of ~2â€“40 minutes, can be modeled by a two-parameter hyperbolic equation (see methods below). Critical power (or speed) is the highest power that can be sustained primarily by aerobic metabolism while still achieving a metabolic steady state. Critical power (or speed) is also a metabolic threshold such that exercising at powers (or speeds) above CP will cause increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism and a greater accumulation of fatigue-inducing metabolites. For a given power above CP, the time until task failure is dependent on the magnitude of W', suggesting that W' can be viewed as a fatigue buffer (or fatigue constant). 


## Methods

### Cycling
The data are fit using a two parameter hyperbolic model according to the equation below:

$$
t = \frac{D'}{P - CP} \
$$

where `t` is the performance time (s), `W'` is the curvature constant (Joules), `P`is the performance power (W), and `CP` is the Critical Power (W). 

Two additional variables that are calculated in the application are:

1. **5 minute Power** - An estimate of the power that can be sustained for 5 minutes.
2. **20 minute Power** - An estimate of the power that can be sustained for 20 minutes.


#### Running
The data are fit using a two parameter hyperbolic model according to the equation below:

$$
t = \frac{D'}{S - CS} \
$$

where `t` is the performance time (s), `D'` is the curvature constant (m), `S` is the average speed (m/s), and `CS` is the critical speed (m/s).

Two additional variables that are calculated in the application are:

1. **Mile** - An estimate of the best mile performance.
2. **5,000m** - An estimate of the best mile performance.


## Usage

Upload data using the browse button (visitors can use the demo data). The first fitting point defaults to 6 seconds, but it should be adjusted to the first data point after time zero (exercise start) that is higher than the baseline. The first fitting point can be adjusted using the slider on the right.
