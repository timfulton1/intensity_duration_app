## Background

The sustainable duration of exercise is dependent upon the intensity (i.e., power or speed) at which the exercise is performed. This fundamental concept is known as the intensity-duration relationship, and for exercise durations of ~2â€“40 minutes, can be modeled by a two-parameter hyperbolic equation (see methods below). The critical intensity (power or speed) is the highest intensity that can be sustained primarily by aerobic metabolism while still achieving a metabolic steady state. The critical intensity is also a metabolic threshold such that exercising at intensities (powers or speeds) above the threshold will cause increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism and a greater accumulation of fatigue-inducing metabolites. For a given intensity above the threshold, the time until task failure is dependent on the magnitude of the curvature constant (W' or D'), suggesting that curvature constant can be viewed as a fatigue buffer (or fatigue constant). 


## Methods

### Cycling
The data are fit using a two parameter hyperbolic model according to the equation below:

$$
t = \frac{D'}{P - CP} \
$$

where `t` is the performance time (s), `W'` is the curvature constant (Joules), `P`is the performance power (W), and `CP` is the Critical Power (W). 

Two additional variables that are calculated in the application are:

1. **5 minute Power** - An estimate of the highest power that can be sustained for 5 minutes.
2. **20 minute Power** - An estimate of the highest power that can be sustained for 20 minutes.


### Running
The data are fit using a two parameter hyperbolic model according to the equation below:

$$
t = \frac{D'}{S - CS} \
$$

where `t` is the performance time (s), `D'` is the curvature constant (m), `S` is the average speed (m/s), and `CS` is the critical speed (m/s).

Two additional variables that are calculated in the application are:

1. **Mile** - Estimated one mile performance.
2. **5,000 m** - Estimated 5K performance.


## Usage

- Enter power and duration data for at least 3 performances.
- Each performance can be either a time to exhaustion test at a constant power or a fixed distance time trial (e.g., 4 km). If using a fixed distance time trial, power may vary throughout the effort, so use the average power over the entire distance.
- For the most accurate estimation of Critical Power and W Prime, choose performances lasting between ~3 and ~20 minutes, spread across this range. For example, durations of 5, 10, and 15 minutes would provide a better estimation than durations of 4, 6, and 8 minutes.
